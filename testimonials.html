                    It [the workshop on creating accessible PDFs for the University Library] was one of the most useful
                    Zoom presentations I have watched here at UIC... Thank you for making this interesting and
                    intelligible to those of us who have not yet worked with accessibility issues.

                    Your homepage shows the community of folks who have invested in training, and it's like, wow, this
                    is a lot of people who really believe in supporting digital accessibility. That drew me to your site
                    and implies that UIC is doing some incredible things.

                    I looked around your website, the documents, the support, and everything you offer is really
                    impressive. It allows for your community to have self-service—first you're training them, and then
                    you are offering those support elements very openly.

                    I get the sense that your work is [authentic] and not a look-alike... I can see that you truly are
                    doing the work by the community members who are there, and really, the thought and effort that has
                    been placed into all of the resources that you're providing.
